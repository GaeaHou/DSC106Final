    <h2>Project Writeup</h2>
    <h3>1. What have we done so far?</h3>
    <p>
      So far, we have built the structural framework of the webpage and completed the introductory animation section. We have also preprocessed the dataset and manually corrected issues with formatting and inconsistent values. Based on the cleaned data, We trained a model to simulate glucose trends in response to different foods. Using this model, We created a visualization that shows how glucose levels change across different individuals after eating. Additionally, we designed and implemented the user interface for selecting specific individuals and dates. The page also includes a chart that updates dynamically based on user input. This interactive design helps users explore personalized glucose responses. I also implemented tooltips and a reset function to enhance usability.
    </p>

    <h3>2. What will be the most challenging part of our project to design and why?</h3>
    <p>
      One challenging aspect is designing smooth, meaningful animation transitions that enhance rather than distract from the user experience. It's also difficult to strike a balance between storytelling and visualizationâ€”presenting medical or biological insights in a way that feels narrative-driven yet data-accurate. Another major challenge lies in data interpretation: glucose responses vary greatly between individuals, so extracting useful patterns without overfitting is tricky. Finally, implementing intuitive, responsive interactions (like brushing, filtering, or adaptive scaling) in the D3-based visualization requires careful coding and user experience testing. All of these elements must work seamlessly together to deliver an engaging and informative experience.
